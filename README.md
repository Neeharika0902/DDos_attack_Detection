# DDos_attack_Detection
In the era of IoT, with over 25 billion devices, DDoS attacks pose significant threats. Our project employs adaptive machine learning models, leveraging the NetBIOS dataset for training. Using algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, and techniques like SMOTE and PCA, I aim to enhance real-time DDoS detection and mitigation.
